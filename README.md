# XOR_and_XNOR-operation-
The task in this project was simple ..

Here, is the entire task..

We created a Neural Net in NumPy which either computes the xor or the xnor of two one bit binary numbers depending on the value of a third input. If the third input is 0, the neural net should compute the xor of the two numbers and if the third input is 1, the neural net should compute the xnor of the two numbers.

X1(first bit) | X2(second bit) | X3(task) | Y
